# Anomaly_Detection_with_TimeSeriesForcasting
It is Anomaly Detection code using Time series Forecasting .I have used ARIMA model to predict trends of usage of CPU.
I have taken two data set that are (cpu-train-a,cpu-train-b) and (cpu-test-a,cpu-test-b) 
I have trained the model with these two datasets.
Tested the model with some random data and an alert is given when there is a deviation in the trends.
The observed values(Anomalies) fall within the low-confidence bands, so it will raise an anomaly alert.
